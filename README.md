# Playpause for Hermes on OS X

Freaking waste of a framework that's what! This is a simple app to play and
pause Hermes for OS X, a native OS X Pandora client (Not the official shit AIR
version).

Visit `/playpause` to playpause Hermes.

This project was meant to be exported as a JAR file that you can just run on
a Mac with Java and Hermes. There's no security and it's best for a LAN where
everybody knows each other's names.
